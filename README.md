# Tic Tac Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe Game in JavaScript.

Home Page:
Player gets an option to select to play as Single Player VS the computer
   OR Player can choose to play as MultiPlayer.
   
 Multi Player
 User gets an option to Enter the Name of both players (Player1 and Player2.)
 When the user clicks Start Game Button it directs to the Game Board.
 At the top corners the player names would be displayed if the User had entered any names.
 When the user Wins, it displays the name of the Winner(if the name was entered.)
 OR else it will show It's a Tie!

 Single Player
 When the user clicks to play as a Single player vs the Computer, it directs the user to the game board.
 The user plays the first turn for 'O' and then next the computer will play as 'X'.
 I have used the Minimax Algorithm to create the computer player.
 When the player wins it displays the screen as "You Win" or when the computer wins it displays "Computer Wins."
 OR when a tie it displays "It's a Tie!"
